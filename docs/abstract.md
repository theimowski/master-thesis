ABSTRACT
========
    
Despite computer science having its roots at universities, it is evident that at some point software industry detached from academic stream to live its own life.
Software and programming researchers concentrate on aspects of correctness and mathematical properties that are closely related to functional programming.
Meanwhile, non-functional paradigms have dominated the industry, with majority of companies investing a lot into projects based on object-oriented programming languages.
This thesis aims to highlight recent peak in functional programming interest, as a way to overcome issues introduced by counterpart approaches.
Concept of functional programming is precisely presented together with explanation of the basic foundations and their practical usage examples.
Listed are the most popular functional languages with their adoption among serious companies in business applications.
Programming fields where the paradigm is extremely prominent are outlined, accompanied by justification for why other techniques are left behind.
The thesis culminates with a demonstration of a business web application written in functional manner guided by plenty of code listings, emphasizing benefits gained from applying functional programming.
