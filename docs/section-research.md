Domain choice
-------------

Functional Programming is already present in a significant amount of areas. 
There are however fields, where it is still not widely adopted. One of such fields is **Web Development**. 
Here, Object-Oriented programming seems to be a strong leader with regards to number of existing frameworks, libraries and tools as well as popularity among software engineers. 
In order to verify whether Functional Programming could potentially be applied to software from any domain, decision has been made to discover how it would fit this relatively foreign area - Web Development.
