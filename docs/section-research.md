RESEARCH
========

Previous section described how Functional Programming managed to be successfully applied in many projects.
In this section focus will be laid on creating software that uses functional techniques.
For that purpose, process of developing such application will be shown.
In the course of this section, multiple comparisons will be made between Object-Oriented and Functional approaches.

Domain choice
-------------

Functional Programming is already present in a significant amount of areas. 
There are however fields, where it is still not widely adopted. One of such fields is **Web Development**. 
Here, Object-Oriented programming seems to be a strong leader with regards to number of existing frameworks, libraries and tools as well as popularity among software engineers. 
In order to verify whether Functional Programming could potentially be applied to software from arbitrary domain, decision has been made to discover how it would fit this relatively foreign area - Web Development.

Another reason why Web Development domain has been chosen was a will to contribute to the F# community.
As the F# language is getting more and more interest, the language community is doing its best to encourage developers to give F# a try.
On one of mailing groups there appeared a suggestion to prepare a tutorial on how to create Web applications with F#.
This turned out to be a great candidate for research part of this thesis.

Functional Web
--------------

Even though Web Development is usually associated with using imperative techniques, it's not completely uncommon to follow functional principles while creating Internet applications.
