PROGRAMING PARADIGMS
====================

Paradigms survey
----------------

There is a lot of programming languages in use nowadays.
TIOBE Index web site, which examines popularity of programming languages, keeps track of more than 150 programming languages {{{tiobeindex}}}, while the total number of all *notable* programming languages exceeds a thousand {{{wikilistpl}}}.

The most common classification of programming languages relies on programming paradigms. 
Paradigm determines some kind of abstract pattern that is followed by a family of languages.
The concept was first known as Stuctured Programming {{{dijkstra1970notes}}}.
In 1978, Floyd received Turing Award for his paper, where he described the notion of paradigm and how it can influnce language designers {{{floyd1979paradigms}}}.
Those early works on paradigms of programming prove that the concept has been studied since the beggining of software industry.
