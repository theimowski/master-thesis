PROGRAMING PARADIGMS
====================

There is a lot of programming languages in use nowadays.
TIOBE Index web site, which examines popularity of programming languages, keeps track of more than 150 programming languages {{{tiobeindex}}}, while the total number of all *notable* programming languages exceeds a thousand {{{wikilistpl}}}.

The most common classification of programming languages relies on programming paradigms. 
Paradigm determines some kind of abstract pattern that is followed by a family of languages.
The concept was first known as Structured Programming {{{dijkstra1970notes}}}.
In 1978, Floyd received Turing Award for his paper, where he described the notion of paradigm and how it can influence language designers {{{floyd1979paradigms}}}.
Those early works on paradigms of programming prove that the concept has been studied since the beginning of software industry.

In this section focus will be laid on surveying most popular programming paradigms.
It must be emphasized that a single programming language usually spans over a few paradigms.
The paradigms are not thus mutually exclusive.
