INTRODUCTION AND AIM OF THE THESIS
==================================

Computer science is a field with strong academic background.
Plenty of studies concern areas such as hardware engineering, computing technology, algorithms, information technology and **software engineering**.
The last is undoubtedly one of the most remunerative realm of computer science.
One can however get the impression that at some point, software industry detached from academic stream to live its own life.
While scholars focused on proving how **mathematics** influences the theory of computation, dogmatists strived to show that these two do not have much in common.
The latter managed to convince the society that imperative programming is the key to solving all kinds of computational challenges.
Object-oriented programming (OOP), which originated from the imperative movement is the dominant paradigm in the enormous software industry.
On the other hand functional programming (FP), born from the declarative branch of programming paradigms as a major subject of studies on programming in universities, did not get much notice in software business around the world.
Luckily, recent trend shows that FP is gaining more and more interest among software developers as well as real-world, business use cases.

The aim of this thesis is to describe how FP appeared at the stage, what it has to offer as opposed to its counterpart approaches, in which programming areas it is visible and what does a process of creating application with functional paradigm in mind look like.
